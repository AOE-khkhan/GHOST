# GHOST
GHOST, Generic Human Operating System Terminal. This is a general purpose artificial intelligence system able to understand the human communication and execute commands when asked to.

## Approach
  The base target is to achieve spatial intelligence with the agent. Make the agent understance space to be able to move from a point A to B. This involves a Detect, Act and Loop methodology. To achive this an image detection system had to be constructed first.
  The image processsor's goal is to be able to define states and identify the similar states. The next step is to understand the actions that can be performed in that respective state.
  
## Why Not Neural Networks?
  You might be wondering why neural networks were not used. Well, neural networks are very impressive but I personally don't see them as the foundation of building an AGI. I believe it will be used eventually maybe as a guiding system (like in a GAN) or something else but for now neural networks are not included in this model.
