I can't walk without watching where I'm going
I can't speak without knowing what to say
I can't love and have any hesitation
Cause I know that you don't work that way

I can't reach without something to offer
I can't come now I am so ashamed
I can't hold out from you any longer
Cause I know that you don't work that way

I'm not gonna fight you anymore
Not gonna try to lock the door
You took your life and gave me yours
There's no reason why
I shouldn't trust you with mine

It's never easy changing my direction
It's so unnatural to loosen up my grip
Are you growing weary of all my good intentions
Cause I know that You don't work that way

Chorus

Somedays
This wait upon my shoulder
Is my shame
I know I should know better
Cause you say
That I must now surrender
There's no other way

My train pulled in to Waterloo
I found myself wishing you
Were here with me in London
Standing on the river Thames
Taking photographs of Parliament
And old Big Ben was ringing

You know it's everything that I imagined it would be
I had no idea that it would feel this empty

Love is not proud
Love does not boast
Love after all
Matters the most

Love does not run
Love does not hide
Love does not keep
Locked inside

Love is the river that flows through
Love never fails you

Love will sustain
Love will provide
Love will not cease
At the end of time

Love will protect
Love always hopes
Love still believes
When you don't

Love is the arms that are holding you
Love never fails you

When my heart won't make a sound
When I can't turn back around
When the sky is falling down
Nothing is greater than this
Greater than this

Love is right here
Love is alive
Love is the way
The truth the life

Love is the river that flows through
Love is the arms that are holding you
Love is the place you will fly to
Love never fails you

Where are you tonight
While I stand here and cry
Watching double-decker buses pass me by
And to tell you the truth
It's all that I can do
To keep from jumping a plane that's headed home
To you

I took a stroll down Abbey Road
Tried to peak inside the studio's
And somewhere along the way I bought you flowers
And a pocket map of the Underground
Cause You and I both know I get turned around
I'm so lost without you

Though it's everything that I imagined it would be
I had no idea that it would feel this empty

Chorus

6 long nights and seven days I'll cross the pond back to the states
I can't wait

Where are you tonight while I stand here and cry
Watching all the black umbrellas pass me by
And to tell you the truth it's all that I can do
To keep from jumping on a plane headed home
So I'm jumping on a plane headed home to you

No better word than from your lips
No perfect life than what you lived
No greater gift, no not one

No brighter star has ever shined

No better hope for all mankind 
No higher mind, no not one

No one has ever known
This kind of love you've shown

There has never been a greater love
Than your son
No. Not one
And there'll never be a greater love
No, Not one
With his life you have forgiven us
Hope has come
Hope has come
And there will never be a greater love
No, Not one

No image true or sweeter frame
No simple word can match your name
No greater fame
No not one

No one has ever seen
The depth of your majesty

Chorus

No greater call
You gave us all a reason to live 
No greater love
You gave us all a reason to give
No greater life
You gave us all a reason to shine
No greater love
Forever mine

"Steady Now"

There's an air, everywhere
Of inconsideration and despair
I don't consider you
And you don't consider me
And it's well understood
We don't care

You know we don't have to wait until the end of the night
Just to say that something's wrong and maybe nobody's right
We're all victims in a battle
We never had to fight
It's okay
It's alright
Steady now
We're in this thing together

We're in this thing together

I regret that I forget
Confessions always seem to stay unsaid
And maybe I worry 
That you'll forsake me
Use my shame as a weapon
And go on and break me

You know we don't have to wait until the end of the night
Just to say that something's wrong and maybe nobody's right
We're all victims in a battle
We never had to fight
It's okay
It's alright
Steady now

We're in this thing together

Cause I want to take the time to say I'm sorry
I haven't loved you the way I should
Do you think that you could 
Forgive me
Just try to hear me out
I need you with me now

You know we don't have to wait until the end of the night
Just to say that something's wrong and maybe nobody's right
We're all victims in a battle
We never had to fight
It's okay
It's alright

You know we don't have to wait until the end of the night
Just to say that something's wrong and maybe nobody's right
We're all victims in a battle
We never had to fight
It's okay
It's alright
Steady now

We're in this thing together
Steady now

Comfortable, don't get comfortable.

Then I'm gonna move you in.

Yesterday

"Our God Reigns"

Yours and so much mine
By the morning, light is Thine
Perfect by design

Mighty to man, light of the earth
Sending His Son to echo His worth
Breaker of sin, winner of souls
Every creature will know 


Our God reigns over the heavens
Over the earth, Our God reigns
Praise His name, All still standing
All that was, all that remains
Our God reigns 

Deepest Ocean opened wide
So shall love divide
In devotion to His bride
Standing by her side

Mighty to man, Light of the earth
He's sending His Son to echo His worth
Breaker of sin, winner of souls
Every creature will know 

Our God reigns over the heavens
Over the earth, Our God reigns
Praise His name, All still standing
All that was, all that remains
Our God reigns 

So much Holy, So divine
Yours and so much mine
