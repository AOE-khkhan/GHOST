The Convention
===============
Variable names: lowercase_separated by underscores
Functions and methods: camelCase
Constants: UPPERCASE seperated by underscore
Class name: Capitalize each word

Note
=====
-for the clustering: mean of all or mean of non-zeros can be used[
	this change can be effected in the sortIndices method in memory_line.py
	mean+stdev can also be considered
	*mean of nonzero is being used as it seem to converge than the rest
]

-for the indices: euclidean distance is used but is not unique and concides with matrices that not similar(bad for clustering)[
	the change can be effected in the util.py resultant function
	also change the deafult argument by_indices to True in sortIndices method in memory_line.py
]


-for the daton, there is  the choice to use subset of the mean of class kernels or mean of class kernels as it is[
	right now it is mean of class kernels
]

-physics[
	to find similarity and model physical laws
	similarity [
		Ax = B
		A - image1, B - image2, x is a tranformation matrix representing the physical change that affected the system
		Min [B - TupleSet(int(Ax))]
	]

]

TESTs
======
when i used 2x2 kernels i got a convergence of 0.009 to 0.012

PROBLEMS
=========
The scale and skew of the image[
	hope to learn this by making it understand the physics of the world
]

CORE of AGI
===========
-Abstract concept representation
-Language
-Abstract concept recognition and processing
