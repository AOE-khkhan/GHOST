The Convention
===============
Variable names: lowercase_separated by underscores
Functions and methods: camelCase
Constants: UPPERCASE seperated by underscore
Class name: Capitalize each word

Note
=====
-for the clustering: mean of all or mean of non-zeros can be used[
	this change can be effected in the sortIndices method in memory_line.py
	mean+stdev can also be considered
	*mean of nonzero is being used as it seem to converge than the rest
]

-for the indices: euclidean distance is used but is not unique and concides with matrices that not similar(bad for clustering)[
	the change can be effected in the util.py resultant function
	also change the deafult argument by_indices to True in sortIndices method in memory_line.py
]


-for the daton, there is  the choice to use subset of the mean of class kernels or mean of class kernels as it is[
	right now it is mean of class kernels
]

TESTs
======
when i used 2x2 kernels i got a convergence of 0.009 to 0.012
