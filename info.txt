Constants: UPPERCASE seperated by underscore
Class name: Capitalize each word

Note
=====
-for the clustering: mean of all or mean of non-zeros can be used[
	this change can be effected in the sortIndices method in memory_line.py
	mean+stdev can also be considered
]

-for the indices: euclidean distance is used but is not unique and concides with matrices that not similar(bad for clustering)[
	the change can be effected in the util.py resultant function
	also change the deafult argument by_indices to True in sortIndices method in memory_line.py
]
