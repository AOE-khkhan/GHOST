-physics[
	to find similarity and model physical laws
	similarity [
		Ax = B
		A - image1, B - image2, x is a tranformation matrix representing the physical change that affected the system
		Min [B - TupleSet(int(Ax))]

		had an idea to use (minimum) energy required to move from one image state to another as a similarit function [maybe a quantum computer can do this]
